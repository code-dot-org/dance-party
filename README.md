Steps to get up and running
```
git clone git@github.com:code-dot-org/dance-party.git
cd dance-party
nvm install
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```

At this point the app will be running at localhost:8080. Open the developer tools in Chrome and you can access the API via `nativeAPI.*`

If you want to make changes locally in dance-party and have them show up in your apps build, do the following
- In the dance-party directory `yarn link`
- In the apps directory `yarn link @code-dot-org/dance-party`

This will set up a symlink in apps/node_modules to point at your local changes. Run `npm run build` in dance-party, and then the apps build should pick the changes up next time it builds.

To debug unit tests in the Chrome debugger:
`node --inspect --debug-brk ./node_modules/.bin/tape ./test/unit/*.js`
Open [chrome://inspect](chrome://inspect) in Chrome browser (requires Chrome 55+)
Tap on `inspect` link under "Remote Target"

### Adding New Characters
To add a new character to Dance Party, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/code-dot-org/dance-spritesheets to create the spritesheet for the character.

### Effects Testing
`npm run test:visual` uses [pixelmatch](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch#readme) to test for consistency in screenshots between your local branch and an accepted 
baseline. Accepted baselines are saved in `test/visual/fixtures`.
To debug a test failure, run `node ./test/visual/helpers/generateScreenshot.js <effectName> <pathToDirectory>`
to output the local screenshot to the given directory. If a baseline does not exist for a given effect, the screenshot 
from your local branch is saved as the baseline. Effects are drawn with no characters on the screen so effects appear 
the same when drawn as backgrounds or foregrounds.

#### To Add Test Coverage For a New Effects
Add the name of the effect to the list of effects in `backgrounds.js`. Run `npm run test:visual`. 
After a new baseline is generated, manually inspect it to ensure it matches expectations.

#### To Update A Baseline
Delete the accepted baseline. Run `npm run test:visual`. After a new baseline is generated, manually inspect 
it to ensure it matches expectations.
